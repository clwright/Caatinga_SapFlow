# Contrasting water use  revealed by transpiration dynamics in the Caatinga 

This repository contains the data used for the paper: [Contrasting water use strategies revealed by species-specific transpiration dynamics in the Caatinga dry forest](https://academic.oup.com/treephys/advance-article/doi/10.1093/treephys/tpad137/7342201?utm_source=advanceaccess&utm_campaign=treephys&utm_medium=email). 

The general aim of this paper was to better understand how the sap flux density of species with low vs. high wood densities differ in their sensitivity to vapor pressure deficit and soil water content, and how potentially opposing water use strategies influence transpiration dynamics and ultimately correlations to evapotranspiration. The data contained in this repository is species-level data. 

1. **SFdaily.csv**
   * Date: date 
   * Sps: 4-letter species code
   * SapFlux_g_s_m2: sap flux density in g per s per sq. m
   * SapFlow_cm3water_s: saf flow or transpiration in cubic cm of water per s
   * VPD_kPa: vapor pressure deficit in kPa
   * Avrg_VWC0_50: average volumetric water content of top 50 cm of soil, in percent or cubic cm per cubic cm
   * Hindex: the hysteresis area index of sap flux density vs vapor pressure deficit; this values is on a  range of 0-1
2. **LWP.csv**
   * Date: date
   * Sps: 4-letter species code
   * PD_MPa: pre-dawn leaf water potential, in MPa
