# Contrasting water use  revealed by transpiration dynamics in the Caatinga 

This repository contains the data and R code used for the paper: [Contrasting water use strategies revealed by species-specific transpiration dynamics in the Caatinga dry forest](https://academic.oup.com/treephys/advance-article/doi/10.1093/treephys/tpad137/7342201?utm_source=advanceaccess&utm_campaign=treephys&utm_medium=email). 

The aim of this paper was to better understand how the sap flux density of species with low vs. high wood densities differ in their sensitivity to vapor pressure deficit and soil water content, and how potentially opposing water use strategies influence transpiration dynamics and ultimately correlations to evapotranspiration. The code includes hysteresis area analysis to quantify the sensitivity of species-specific sap flux density to changes in vapor pressure deficit and breakpoint-based models to determine the soil water content threshold instigating a transpiration response. The paper also presents a multiscalar wavelet coherency to correlate transpiration to evapotranspiration, but that code is not avaiable at this time. The evapotranspiration data is not included in this repository, as it is owned by collaborators and has not been released to the public.   

The document structure of this respository follows.  
1. SF_Data: contains species-level data
2. SF_Code: contains R code used to clean data and generate plots
3. SF_Figure: contains the output figure as a tiff
